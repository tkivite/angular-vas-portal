 * Some features used by Angular 7 are not yet supported natively by all major browsers, * polyfills are used to add support for features where necessary so your Angular 7 
 * application works across all major browsers.
 * This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and is loaded before the app.
 * You can add your own extra polyfills to this file.
 *
 * 
 * Zone JS is required by default for Angular itself.
