This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.

## Prepare development environment- what you will need:
 # Node.js version 8.x or 10.x  run node -v in a terminal to check your version.

    apt-get install -y nodejs

# Npm package manager- to download and install libraries and packages. run npm -v in a terminal to check if installed
    pm client command line interface is installed with Node.js by default.
# Angular CLI
    npm install -g @angular/cli
